This portfolio website is a responsive and visually appealing personal web page designed to showcase my profile, technical skills, and projects in a structured and professional manner. The main objective of this portfolio is to create a strong online presence that highlights my background as a Computer Engineering student and my interest in Web Development and Software Engineering.

The website is built using HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring a clean layout, semantic structure, and modern design principles. The HTML structure is well-organized into different sections such as Header, Navigation, About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact, and Footer. Each section is clearly defined and easy to navigate, providing a smooth user experience.

The header section introduces my name, “Payal Shewale,” along with a brief professional title. It uses a gradient background to create an attractive first impression. The navigation bar allows users to quickly move to different sections of the page using anchor links, improving usability and accessibility.

The About Me section provides a concise overview of my academic background and technical interests. It emphasizes my passion for web development, hands-on experience with front-end technologies, and my enthusiasm for building real-time and interactive web applications. This section helps visitors understand my goals and professional direction.

The Skills section is designed using a responsive grid layout. It highlights my technical competencies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React (Basic), Node.js, MySQL, and Python. Each skill is displayed in a visually distinct card style, making it easy for recruiters or evaluators to quickly scan my technical strengths.

The Projects section showcases my practical experience through real-world applications. The Real-Time Chat Application demonstrates my understanding of backend integration and real-time communication using Node.js and Socket.io. The Interactive Quiz Application highlights my ability to build dynamic and user-friendly interfaces using JavaScript. This section reflects my problem-solving skills and ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementations.

The Contact section provides essential communication details such as email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links, enabling easy professional connectivity. Additionally, a Download Resume button allows users to access my resume directly, which adds convenience and professionalism.

The website is fully responsive, using CSS media queries to ensure proper display on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. A consistent color scheme, rounded cards, and subtle shadows enhance the overall visual appeal while maintaining readability.

In conclusion, this portfolio website serves as an effective platform to present my skills, projects, and professional identity.
